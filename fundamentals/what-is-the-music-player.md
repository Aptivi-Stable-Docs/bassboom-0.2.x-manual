# What is the music player?

A music player, usually found on almost all your devices that play audio, is an application that allows you to play any music file stored either on your computer or on a remote computer. Music players usually come with the most basic features, such as seeking, changing volumes, forward and backward, and playlists.

Music players can optionally include awesome features, such as lyrics, music visualizer, music equalizer, music metadata information viewer and editor, and internet FM radio support (IceCast, SHOUTcast, etc.).

There are speaker devices that play your audio CDs. Such devices read all the music files and play them automatically. You can control these devices by pressing buttons, such as pause, stop, volume, forward, and backward buttons.

BassBoom is one such music player. To learn more about BassBoom, click on the below page:
