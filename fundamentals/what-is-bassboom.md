# What is BassBoom?

BassBoom aims to be a cross-platform music player that allows you to play MP3 files from any hard drive installed on your computer, your phone, or on your tablet.

BassBoom comes in two variants:

* BassBoom CLI, which is a music player that uses the Basolia library as the backend, written with Terminaux as the backend for display.
* BassBoom GUI, which is a music player that uses the same library for playing music, written with [Avalonia](https://www.avaloniaui.net/) as the GUI framework.

Additionally, BassBoom provides you with its own backend library, Basolia, which handles all the heavy-lifting for playing music. It also provides a safe API for playing music, getting metadata information, and so on.
