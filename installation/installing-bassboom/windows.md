Before performing the installation, your Windows system must meet the following requirements:

| System     | Framework                                                          | Terminal                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows 7+ | [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) | [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) or Windows 10 cmd.exe |
