# macOS

The only way to upgrade BassBoom in macOS is to unpack the updated files manually. To upgrade, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release ZIP file from [this page](https://github.com/Aptivi/BassBoom/releases).
2. Unpack the ZIP archive to any folder of your choice
3. Open your favorite terminal emulator, like iTerm2, and change the working directory to a folder containing the BassBoom executable
4. Execute `dotnet BassBoom.Cli.dll` to start the kernel
